The difference between `pthread_join` and `pthread_detach` lies in how they handle a thread's termination and its associated resources. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. `pthread_join`

The primary purpose of `pthread_join` is to **wait for a thread to finish execution** and retrieve its exit status (if needed).
  
- **Behavior**:
  - When `pthread_join` is called, the calling thread blocks and waits for the target thread to terminate.
  - After the target thread terminates, `pthread_join` allows the calling thread to:
    - Obtain the **exit status** of the terminated thread (via the second argument).
    - Reclaim resources (like memory) used by the terminated thread.
  
- **When to Use**: You use `pthread_join` when you need to:
  - Ensure that a thread has completed its work before proceeding.
  - Retrieve the exit status of the thread.
  - Properly clean up the resources used by the thread.
  
- **Requirement**: After calling `pthread_join`, the system frees the resources associated with the thread (no "zombie" thread remains). If `pthread_join` is not called on a joinable thread, its resources will not be released and a resource leak (or zombie thread) will occur.

2. `pthread_detach`

The primary purpose of `pthread_detach` is to **allow the system to automatically clean up** the resources of a thread once it has finished execution, without needing another thread to explicitly join it.

- **Behavior**:
  - When `pthread_detach` is called on a thread, it **detaches the thread**, meaning:
    - The calling thread no longer needs to wait for this thread to finish.
    - The thread's resources will be automatically freed by the system once the thread terminates (no need for `pthread_join`).
  - After detaching a thread, you **cannot call `pthread_join` on it**. Trying to join a detached thread results in an error.

- **When to Use**: You use `pthread_detach` when:
  - You don't need the exit status of the thread.
  - You don't need to synchronize with the thread's completion, but you still want the system to clean up the resources when it finishes.

what happens if pthread join is not called in a joinable thread??

If `pthread_join` is not called on a joinable thread, it can lead to a **resource leak** in your program. Here's why:

1. **Thread Termination**: When a thread finishes executing, it doesn't immediately release all of its resources. Instead, it enters a "terminated" state but continues to hold resources (like the thread's stack) until it is "joined" or "detached."

2. **Joinable Threads**: By default, threads created with `pthread_create` are joinable. A joinable thread is one that can be waited on by another thread via `pthread_join` to collect its exit status and release the resources associated with it.

3. **The Consequence of Not Calling `pthread_join`**:
   - If you donâ€™t call `pthread_join` on a joinable thread, the thread's resources (e.g., memory, thread-specific data) are not reclaimed, leading to a situation known as a **"zombie thread"**.
   - Each joinable thread that terminates without a corresponding `pthread_join` causes a **resource leak** (or "zombie thread") that may accumulate over time, consuming system resources such as memory and thread handles.
   
4. **Thread Detachment**: You can also call `pthread_detach` on a thread, which allows the system to reclaim its resources automatically when the thread terminates, without the need for a join. However, after a thread is detached, you cannot call `pthread_join` on it.
